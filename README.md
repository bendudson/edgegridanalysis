# Tokamak edge grid analysis

This package aims to enable automatic generation of grids for tokamak edge
simulations (primarily for UEDGE and BOUT++).

Planned functionality:

1. Analysis of equilibria G-EQDSK
  - Find number and location of X- and O- points
  - Identify limiters and appropriate ranges of poloidal flux

2. Production of configuration scripts to drive grid generators
  - INGRID 
  - Hypnotoad

3. Analysis of grid quality
  - Metrics of mesh smoothness, condition of PDE solves
  - Identify ways to improve the grid
